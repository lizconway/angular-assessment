ToDo application for Angular assessment (Mobile App module)

This app allows you to add items to a ToDo list, and associate the todo item with a category (called type in the app).

The app is divided into 3 sections:
- ToDo
- NewDo
- DueDo

Add a ToDo
----------
Type an explanation of what you want to do into the 'ToDo' box.  Whatever you type will be reflected at the bottom of the ToDo section.
Choose what type of todo this is.  
**NB**  *Even though the todo text appears in the ToDo section, it will not be added to the list until you click the 'Add' button*  
Click the 'Add' button to add this todo to the list.

Complete a ToDo
---------------
Simply tick the checkbox to mark a todo item as completed.  
It will disappear from the todo list, and appear in the DueDo section.

UnDo a ToDo
-----------
Simply tick the checkbox in the DueDo section to undo the todo.  
It will disappear from the DueDo list, and appear in the ToDo section.

Delete a ToDo
-------------
To delete a ToDo :
- Tick the checkbox for a ToDo - it will appear in the DueDo section.
- Click the delete button (the bin icon).
The ToDo item is completely gone.

Edit ToDo Types
---------------
An initial set of ToDo types are included in the app - Home, Work, School.
You can (and probably should) add your own ToDo types, or remove ones you do not want.  
To add or remove ToDo types click the 'Edit Types' button.  
Enter new ToDo types, or delete existing types.  

If a type has todo items associated with it, then that type cannot be deleted and an appropriate error message is displayed.
